# Spring Boot - Troubleshooting with the Database 

This is an application that has errors for you to fix. 
Once you fix all errors, you should be able to: 

- Add items to the database (using the /add path) 
- List all of the items in the database using the default route

Check to make sure your model is well structured, and that all the items you need in all of your classes are in the right place.
