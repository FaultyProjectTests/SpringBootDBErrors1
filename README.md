# Spring Boot - Troubleshooting with the Database 

This is an application that has errors for you to fix. 
Once you fix all errors, you should be able to: 

- Add items to the database (using the /add path) 
- List all of the items in the database using the default route

Check to make sure your model is well structured, and also that you have the correct items specified
